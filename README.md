# Holiduino
Arduino-based AC Light Controller

This is an AC light controller based on the Atmega328P chip (The same chip as the Arduino Uno) that can receive DMX signals, and turn on and off/dim AC lights connected to the 16 outputs. It is designed for controlling Christmas lights in animated Christmas light displays, but it can be used for most dimmable lights that are powered from 120vAC 60Hz. The controller has 2 banks with 8 channels each, for a total of 16 channels. Each bank has a separate zero-cross detector circuit and may be powered from a sepapare circuit or phase, even if they are not exactly 180 degrees apart. For example, in New York City and some additional countries, the 2 phases in most homes are 120 degrees apart, which woulc cause flickering and would not act as desired if each bank was connected to a different phase. This controller will work perfectly in these situations. All components are through-hole, and may be soldered easily by anyone wih little or no soldering experience.
